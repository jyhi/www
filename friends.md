Not many people today set up their own websites and write blog posts. Shorter and more fragmented forms of content creation like microblogging and short video clips seem to be preferred. Fortunately, many others still keep producing great ideas and write excellent blog posts. Below are some of them and their websites. Note that I don't necessarily endorse any content on these sites.
