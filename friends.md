In August 2020, I got a chance to become a certified member of the [Chaihuo Maker Space](https://www.chaihuo.org/), where passionate makers gather. I don't think I'm an _authentic_ maker; I'm interested in playing with hardware, but I didn't invest a lot of time in it. Some _true_ makers I came across in the certified members' chat group also set up their websites to show their results and products. Here are some of them:

- [Curious Bin](http://www.haoqiabin.cn)
