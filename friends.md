It's a pity that nowadays people no longer write high-quality blog posts, but instead seek for acceptance by writing fragmented micro-blogs and WeChat moments. Notwithstanding, many of my friends still keep producing great ideas and write excellent blog posts. Here are some of them:

- [Haonan Bai](https://library.hoshimi.club){:knows}, a schoolmate of mine.
- [Mingcong Bai](https://mingcongbai.wtf){:knows}, maintainer of [AOSC OS](https://aosc.io), history scholar, great thinker.

In August 2020, I got a chance to become a certified member of the [Chaihuo Maker Space](https://www.chaihuo.org/), where passionate makers gather. I don't think I'm an _authentic_ maker; I'm interested in playing with hardware, but I didn't invest a lot of time in it. Some _true_ makers I came across in the certified members' chat group also set up their websites to show their results and products. Here are some of them:

- [Curious Bin \[zh-Hans\]](http://www.haoqiabin.cn){:knows}
- [Meng Cheng (dreamc) \[zh-Hans\]](https://www.dreamcstudio.cn){:knows}
- [IT1995 \[zh-Hans\]](http://www.it1995.cn){:knows}
- [Bo Liu](https://blogs.oopswow.com){:knows}

This site is also included in [TUNA Blogroll](https://github.com/tuna/blogroll#lists), blogs in which are also full of great minds and are worth reading!
