Blog posts are categorised in the following classes:

- blog: Original blog articles.

Under the above categories, language tags are appended:

- en: Blog posts in English.
- cn: Blog posts in (Simplified) Chinese.

There is currently no category-specific list.

I understand that such transition, compared with the old link scheme in my old blog site, brings a lot of [rotted links][link-rot]. If a link rot is found, please either notify me or the one linking to my site.
